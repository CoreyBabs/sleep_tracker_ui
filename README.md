# sleep_tracker_ui

A project to learn flutter and act as the frontend to https://github.com/CoreyBabs/sleep-tracker-gql.

An app to act as a sleep and dream journal. Keep track of quality and amount of sleep, add labels to a night to track patterns,
and add notes to keep a dream journal.

Future Changes (v2.0):
* Stats page: Generate stats based on data and labels
* Better async support
* Refactoring for easier to read and maintain code
